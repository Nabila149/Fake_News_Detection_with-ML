# Fake_News_Detection_with-ML
Bangla Fake News Detection Project This project detects Bangla fake vs. real news using ML models. We apply preprocessing, text vectorization, and train Naive Bayes, Bernoulli NB, and Logistic Regression. Performance is evaluated with accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curves, classification reports, and a heatmap for the correlation matrix.
